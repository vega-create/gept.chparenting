As society evolves, people are becoming more aware of its importance.\n\nResearch shows that education and awareness are crucial. Schools have begun adding relevant courses to help students understand these issues.\n\nCollaboration between government, organizations, and individuals is essential. Working together creates effective solutions.\n\nTechnology provides new tools for progress. Digital platforms help share information and connect people. However, responsible use and equal access are important.\n\nThe future depends on continued effort and innovation. While challenges remain, growing engagement gives reason for optimism.",

Its early warning system detects initial waves and sends alerts within seconds.\n\nBuilding codes are extremely strict. Modern skyscrapers use base isolation systems that move independently from the ground. After the 1995 Kobe earthquake, standards were further strengthened.\n\nPublic education is equally important.
