    passage: "Taiwan occupies a unique position in the global economy. Despite its relatively small size, Taiwan is the world's leading producer of advanced semiconductors, with TSMC manufacturing chips used in everything from smartphones to cars to artificial intelligence systems. This has made Taiwan strategically important to countries around the world. In addition to technology, Taiwan is known for its vibrant culture, democratic values, and high standard of living. Taiwanese businesses have expanded globally, with companies like Giant (bicycles), ASUS (computers), and Gogoro (electric scooters) becoming international brands. Taiwan also plays an important role in global supply chains for electronics, machinery, and petrochemicals. However, Taiwan faces challenges including an aging population, rising housing costs, and complex geopolitical tensions. The island's future depends on its ability to continue innovating, attracting talent, and maintaining strong international relationships. Many observers note that Taiwan's success story offers valuable lessons for other small economies: invest in education, embrace technology, and build industries where you can be the best in the world.",

      passage: "English has become the world's most widely used language for international communication, business, science, and diplomacy. An estimated 1.5 billion people worldwide speak English, though only about 400 million are native speakers. This means that the majority of English communication occurs between non-native speakers.\n\nThe dominance of English is largely a result of historical factors, including British colonialism and American economic and cultural influence in the 20th century. Today, English is the official language of international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and most multinational corporations.\n\nThe global spread of English has both benefits and drawbacks. On the positive side, a common language facilitates international trade, scientific collaboration, and cultural exchange. Researchers from different countries can share findings in English, and businesses can operate more efficiently across borders.\n\nHowever, the dominance of English also threatens linguistic diversity. UNESCO estimates that a language dies every two weeks, and many linguists blame the pressure to learn English for the decline of smaller languages. When a language disappears, unique cultural knowledge, oral traditions, and ways of understanding the world are lost forever.\n\nSome countries have responded by implementing policies to protect their local languages while still teaching English. This bilingual or multilingual approach may offer the best balance between global communication and cultural preservation.",
