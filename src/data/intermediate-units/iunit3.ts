      passage: "The rise of artificial intelligence has sparked both excitement and concern across the globe. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and medical diagnosis tools, AI is transforming nearly every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn the workplace, AI is automating tasks that were once performed by humans. While this increases efficiency and reduces costs, it also raises questions about job security. A recent study estimated that up to 30% of current jobs could be automated by 2030. However, experts also point out that AI will create new types of jobs that don't exist yet.\n\nIn education, AI-powered tools are personalizing learning experiences. Students can receive customized lessons based on their strengths and weaknesses, and teachers can use AI to identify students who need extra help. But there are concerns about data privacy and the digital divide — not all students have equal access to technology.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern about AI is ethics. Should AI be used to make decisions about criminal justice? Who is responsible when an AI system makes a mistake? How do we prevent AI from reinforcing existing biases?\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, it is essential that we develop clear regulations and ethical guidelines. Technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. The future will depend on how wisely we choose to use these powerful tools.",

      passage: "The concept of the metaverse has captured the imagination of technology companies and investors worldwide. The metaverse refers to a shared virtual space where people can interact, work, play, and socialize through digital avatars. While the idea has existed in science fiction for decades, recent advances in virtual reality and augmented reality technology have made it seem increasingly achievable.\n\nSeveral major tech companies have invested billions of dollars in developing metaverse platforms. They envision a future where people attend virtual concerts, try on clothes in digital stores, and collaborate with colleagues in virtual offices. Some companies have already begun hosting meetings and events in virtual spaces.\n\nEducation is another area where the metaverse could have a significant impact. Imagine students taking a virtual field trip to ancient Rome or conducting chemistry experiments in a safe virtual laboratory. Some universities have already started offering courses in virtual reality environments.\n\nHowever, there are significant challenges to overcome. The technology required for a fully immersive metaverse experience is still expensive and not widely accessible. There are also concerns about privacy, addiction, and the potential for the metaverse to further isolate people from real-world social interactions.\n\nWhether the metaverse will become a central part of daily life or remain a niche technology is still unclear. What is certain is that virtual and augmented reality technologies will continue to evolve and find new applications in the years ahead.",
