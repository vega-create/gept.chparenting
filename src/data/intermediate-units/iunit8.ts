      passage: "Income inequality has become one of the most pressing social issues of our time. According to recent data, the richest 1% of the world's population owns more wealth than the bottom 50% combined. This gap has been growing steadily for decades and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe causes of income inequality are complex and interconnected. Globalization has created enormous wealth but has also displaced workers in many industries. Technological advancement has increased productivity but has primarily benefited those with technical skills, leaving others behind. Tax policies in many countries favor the wealthy, allowing them to accumulate more wealth while the middle class struggles.\n\nThe consequences of extreme inequality are far-reaching. Research shows that societies with greater inequality tend to have higher rates of crime, poorer public health, lower educational achievement, and less social mobility. Children born into poverty face significant barriers to success, creating a cycle that is difficult to break.\n\nVarious solutions have been proposed to address this issue. Some advocate for progressive taxation, where the wealthy pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. Others call for increasing the minimum wage, investing in public education and healthcare, and strengthening social safety nets.\n\nCritics argue that some of these measures could harm economic growth or discourage innovation. They suggest that the focus should be on creating more opportunities through education and entrepreneurship rather than redistributing wealth.\n\nRegardless of the approach, most experts agree that addressing income inequality is essential for building a more just and stable society. The question is not whether we should act, but how quickly and decisively we can do so.",

      passage: "Food insecurity remains a persistent challenge in many communities, even in wealthy nations. Food insecurity refers to the lack of reliable access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food. According to the United Nations, approximately 735 million people worldwide face chronic hunger.\n\nIn developed countries, food insecurity often exists alongside food waste. Studies show that roughly one-third of all food produced globally is wasted, either during production, transportation, or by consumers who buy more than they need. This paradox highlights the inefficiency of current food distribution systems.\n\nFood banks and community kitchens play a vital role in addressing food insecurity at the local level. These organizations collect surplus food from restaurants, supermarkets, and farms, and distribute it to families in need. Some innovative programs have also begun using mobile apps to connect businesses with excess food to nearby shelters and food banks.\n\nLong-term solutions to food insecurity require addressing its root causes, which include poverty, inequality, and lack of education about nutrition. School meal programs have proven particularly effective, as they ensure children receive at least one nutritious meal per day while also encouraging school attendance.\n\nTackling food insecurity requires cooperation between governments, businesses, non-profit organizations, and individuals. By reducing food waste, supporting local food banks, and advocating for policies that address poverty, communities can make meaningful progress toward ensuring that everyone has enough to eat.",
