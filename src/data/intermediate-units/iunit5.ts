      passage: "In today's rapidly changing economy, the nature of work is evolving at an unprecedented pace. Remote work, once a rare perk, has become commonplace since the pandemic. A recent survey found that 60% of companies now offer some form of flexible working arrangement.\n\nThis shift has brought both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, employees enjoy greater work-life balance, reduced commuting time, and the freedom to work from anywhere. Companies benefit from access to a global talent pool and reduced office costs.\n\nOn the other hand, remote work can lead to feelings of isolation, difficulty in team collaboration, and blurred boundaries between work and personal life. Many workers report working longer hours at home than they did in the office, leading to increased burnout.\n\nAnother major trend is the growing importance of soft skills. While technical skills remain essential, employers increasingly value communication, adaptability, and emotional intelligence. A LinkedIn survey found that 92% of hiring managers consider soft skills just as important as, or more important than, technical skills.\n\nThe gig economy is also reshaping the employment landscape. More people are choosing freelance or contract work over traditional full-time employment, seeking greater autonomy and variety. However, this comes with trade-offs, including less job security and fewer benefits.\n\nAs the workplace continues to transform, one thing is clear: lifelong learning and adaptability are the keys to career success in the 21st century.",

      passage: "The gig economy has fundamentally changed the nature of work for millions of people around the world. Gig workers, who perform short-term tasks or freelance projects rather than holding traditional full-time jobs, now make up an estimated 15 to 25 percent of the global workforce.\n\nPlatforms like ride-sharing apps, food delivery services, and freelance marketplaces have made it easier than ever for people to find gig work. For many workers, the gig economy offers attractive benefits: flexible schedules, the ability to be their own boss, and the freedom to choose which projects to take on.\n\nHowever, gig work also comes with significant downsides. Most gig workers do not receive benefits like health insurance, paid vacation, or retirement contributions. Their income can be unpredictable, and they have little job security. During economic downturns, gig workers are often the first to lose their income.\n\nGovernments around the world are struggling to create regulations that protect gig workers while preserving the flexibility that makes gig work appealing. Some countries have introduced laws requiring companies to provide minimum benefits to gig workers, while others have classified certain gig workers as employees entitled to full protections.\n\nAs technology continues to evolve, the gig economy is likely to keep growing. The challenge for society is to ensure that this new form of work provides fair compensation and adequate protections for the millions of people who depend on it.",
