      passage: "The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how we think about healthcare. Before the pandemic, many people took their health for granted. Now, public health awareness has reached an all-time high.\n\nOne of the most significant changes has been the rise of telemedicine. During lockdowns, millions of patients turned to video consultations with their doctors. What was once considered a convenience has become a necessity. Studies show that telemedicine visits increased by over 150% during the first year of the pandemic, and many patients prefer it for routine checkups.\n\nMental health has also received unprecedented attention. The isolation, uncertainty, and grief caused by the pandemic led to a surge in anxiety and depression worldwide. Governments and organizations have invested more in mental health services, and there is less stigma around seeking help.\n\nVaccine development has been another remarkable story. Scientists developed effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time — less than a year, compared to the typical 10-15 years for vaccine development. This achievement has opened new possibilities for treating other diseases using similar technology.\n\nHowever, the pandemic also exposed deep inequalities in healthcare. Wealthier nations had better access to vaccines, treatments, and medical equipment, while many developing countries were left behind. Addressing this inequality remains one of the biggest challenges for global health.",

      passage: "Antibiotic resistance has become one of the most serious public health threats of our time. When bacteria develop the ability to survive the drugs designed to kill them, infections become harder to treat and can sometimes become deadly. The World Health Organization has warned that antibiotic resistance could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 if action is not taken.\n\nThe main cause of antibiotic resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. Many people take antibiotics for viral infections like the common cold, even though antibiotics are only effective against bacteria. Additionally, antibiotics are widely used in livestock farming to promote animal growth, which further contributes to the problem.\n\nTo combat antibiotic resistance, doctors are being encouraged to prescribe antibiotics only when absolutely necessary. Patients should always complete their full course of antibiotics, even if they start feeling better. Taking only part of a prescription allows some bacteria to survive and develop resistance.\n\nResearchers are also working on developing new types of antibiotics and alternative treatments. Some promising approaches include using bacteriophages, which are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, and developing vaccines to prevent bacterial infections in the first place.\n\nAddressing antibiotic resistance requires a global effort involving governments, healthcare providers, the agricultural industry, and individual patients. Without coordinated action, we risk returning to an era when simple infections could once again be life-threatening.",
