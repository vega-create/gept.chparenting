    passage: "The relationship between technology and privacy has become one of the most important legal issues of our time. Every day, billions of people share personal information online, often without fully understanding how their data is being collected and used. Social media platforms, search engines, and apps track our behavior, preferences, and even location. While this data collection enables convenient services like personalized recommendations and targeted advertising, it also raises serious privacy concerns. In 2018, the European Union introduced the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives citizens more control over their personal data. Since then, many countries have followed suit with similar legislation. In Taiwan, the Personal Data Protection Act requires companies to obtain consent before collecting personal information. However, enforcement remains a challenge. Many experts believe that privacy laws need to evolve faster to keep up with rapidly advancing technology. The question is not whether we need privacy protection, but how to balance it with the benefits of a connected digital world.",

      passage: "Jury duty is a fundamental part of the justice system in many democratic countries. When called for jury duty, citizens are required to serve on a jury that determines the outcome of legal cases. While some people view jury duty as an inconvenience, it represents one of the most direct ways citizens participate in their government.\n\nThe jury system dates back to ancient Greece and was later adopted into English common law. The principle behind trial by jury is that ordinary citizens, rather than government officials alone, should decide questions of guilt and innocence. This serves as a check on government power and helps ensure fairness in the legal system.\n\nIn most systems, juries consist of 12 members who must reach a unanimous decision in criminal cases. Jurors listen to evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense, receive instructions from the judge about applicable laws, and then deliberate in private to reach their verdict.\n\nThe jury system is not without criticism. Some argue that ordinary citizens may not understand complex legal or scientific evidence. Others point to research showing that jurors can be influenced by biases related to race, gender, or socioeconomic status. There are also concerns that jury duty places a significant burden on working people who may lose income while serving.\n\nDespite these challenges, the jury system remains a cornerstone of democratic justice. It ensures that legal decisions reflect community values and provides citizens with a meaningful role in the administration of justice.",
