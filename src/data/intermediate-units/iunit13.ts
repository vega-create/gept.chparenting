    passage: "The global fashion industry is undergoing a significant transformation. For decades, the industry operated on a fast fashion model, producing cheap clothing quickly and encouraging consumers to buy more. However, this model has serious environmental consequences. The fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions, and millions of tons of clothing end up in landfills each year. In response, a growing number of designers and consumers are embracing sustainable fashion. This includes using organic and recycled materials, reducing waste in production, and creating timeless pieces that last for years instead of just one season. Second-hand clothing has also become trendy, with apps and stores dedicated to pre-owned fashion growing rapidly. In Taiwan, several local designers are leading the sustainable fashion movement by incorporating traditional Taiwanese fabrics and techniques into modern designs. Consumers are also becoming more conscious about their choices, asking questions like 'Who made my clothes?' and 'What is this made of?' While the transformation is still in its early stages, it represents a hopeful shift toward a more responsible fashion industry.",

      passage: "The concept of beauty has varied dramatically across cultures and throughout history. What is considered attractive in one society may be unremarkable or even unappealing in another. Understanding these differences can help us appreciate the diversity of human perspectives on appearance.\n\nIn Western cultures, tanned skin is often associated with health and attractiveness, with many people spending time in the sun or using tanning products. In contrast, many East Asian cultures value pale skin, which has historically been associated with wealth and refinement. This difference reflects distinct cultural histories and values.\n\nBody ideals have also changed significantly over time. In Renaissance Europe, fuller figures were considered beautiful and represented prosperity. Today, Western media often promotes thin body types, although there is a growing movement toward body diversity and acceptance. In some Pacific Island cultures, larger body sizes have traditionally been valued as signs of health and status.\n\nThe global beauty industry generates over 500 billion dollars annually, fueled by advertising that often promotes narrow and unrealistic beauty standards. Social media has amplified these pressures, with filters and editing tools creating images that are impossible to achieve in real life.\n\nHowever, there is growing awareness of the psychological harm caused by unrealistic beauty standards. Movements promoting body positivity, natural beauty, and self-acceptance are gaining momentum. Many brands are now featuring diverse models of different sizes, ages, and ethnicities in their campaigns.",
