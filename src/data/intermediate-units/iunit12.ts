    passage: "Taiwanese food culture is one of the most diverse in the world. Night markets are the heart of Taiwanese cuisine, offering everything from stinky tofu and oyster omelets to bubble tea and shaved ice. What makes Taiwanese food special is the fusion of different culinary traditions — Japanese, Chinese, and indigenous influences all blend together. In recent years, Taiwanese cuisine has gained international recognition. Michelin awarded stars to several Taipei restaurants, and Taiwanese bubble tea has become a global phenomenon. However, alongside this success, there are concerns about food safety and the excessive use of processed ingredients. Many consumers are now choosing organic products and supporting local farmers. The farm-to-table movement is growing, with restaurants sourcing ingredients directly from nearby farms. Food education has also become important in schools, teaching children about nutrition, cooking skills, and the importance of eating a balanced diet. As Taiwanese food continues to evolve, it maintains its core values: fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and the joy of sharing meals with others.",

      passage: "The global food waste crisis is staggering in scale. According to the United Nations, approximately one-third of all food produced worldwide is wasted every year. This amounts to roughly 1.3 billion tons of food, worth over one trillion dollars. Meanwhile, nearly 800 million people around the world do not have enough to eat.\n\nFood waste occurs at every stage of the supply chain. In developing countries, most waste happens during production and storage due to inadequate infrastructure and technology. In wealthy nations, waste is concentrated at the retail and consumer levels, where perfectly edible food is discarded for cosmetic reasons or because it has passed arbitrary expiration dates.\n\nThe environmental impact of food waste is significant. When food ends up in landfills, it decomposes and produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Food waste is responsible for approximately 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSolutions are emerging from both the private and public sectors. Some supermarkets now sell imperfect produce at discounted prices. Food rescue organizations collect surplus food from businesses and redistribute it to people in need. Apps have been developed that allow consumers to purchase unsold meals from restaurants at reduced prices.\n\nReducing food waste requires action from everyone, from governments implementing better policies to individuals planning meals more carefully and storing food properly. Even small changes in daily habits can make a significant difference in addressing this global challenge.",
