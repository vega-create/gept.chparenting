      passage: "Education is undergoing a dramatic transformation in the 21st century. The traditional model of a teacher standing in front of a classroom, delivering lectures to rows of students, is being replaced by more dynamic and student-centered approaches.\n\nOne of the biggest changes is the rise of technology in education. From interactive whiteboards and educational apps to AI-powered tutoring systems, technology is making learning more engaging and personalized. Students can learn at their own pace, review difficult concepts as many times as they need, and access resources from anywhere in the world.\n\nAnother significant trend is the emphasis on skills rather than just knowledge. In the past, education focused primarily on memorizing facts and passing exams. Today, educators recognize that critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication — often called the 4Cs — are equally important for success in the modern world.\n\nThe role of the teacher is also changing. Rather than being the sole source of knowledge, teachers are becoming facilitators and mentors who guide students through the learning process. This shift requires new teaching methods and ongoing professional development.\n\nHowever, not everyone has benefited equally from these changes. The digital divide means that students in wealthier areas have access to better technology and resources, while those in underserved communities are left behind. Ensuring equal access to quality education remains one of the greatest challenges of our time.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of education is promising. As technology continues to evolve and our understanding of how people learn deepens, we have the opportunity to create educational experiences that are more effective, inclusive, and inspiring than ever before.",

      passage: "Finland's education system is widely regarded as one of the best in the world, consistently ranking at the top of international assessments. What makes Finland's approach unique is that it seems to contradict many common educational practices found in other countries.\n\nFinnish students do not start formal schooling until the age of seven, later than most other countries. They have shorter school days, receive minimal homework, and do not take standardized tests until the end of high school. Despite this seemingly relaxed approach, Finnish students consistently outperform their peers in reading, mathematics, and science.\n\nThe success of Finland's system is often attributed to several key factors. First, teaching is a highly respected and competitive profession. Only the top 10 percent of graduates are accepted into teacher training programs, and all teachers must hold a master's degree. Second, the system emphasizes equality, ensuring that every student receives a high-quality education regardless of their background.\n\nAnother distinctive feature is the focus on student well-being. Finnish schools prioritize play, creativity, and social skills alongside academic learning. Students have frequent breaks throughout the day, and outdoor play is encouraged even in cold weather.\n\nWhile Finland's model may not be directly transferable to every country, it offers valuable lessons about the importance of trusting teachers, reducing unnecessary testing, and prioritizing the overall well-being of students.",
