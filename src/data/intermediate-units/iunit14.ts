    passage: "Managing personal finances is a skill that everyone should learn, yet many schools do not teach it. A recent survey in Taiwan found that nearly 60% of young adults struggle with budgeting and have little to no savings. Financial literacy experts suggest following the 50/30/20 rule: spend 50% of your income on needs like rent and food, 30% on wants like entertainment and dining out, and save 20%. Starting to invest early is also crucial. Thanks to compound interest, even small monthly investments can grow significantly over time. For example, investing just 3,000 NT dollars per month starting at age 25 could grow to over 5 million by retirement, assuming an average annual return of 7%. However, it's important to diversify investments and not put all your money in one place. The rise of digital banking and fintech apps has made managing money easier than ever. Many apps now help users track spending, set savings goals, and invest automatically. While the economy will always have ups and downs, having a solid financial plan helps weather any storm.",

      passage: "The concept of financial independence has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly among younger generations. Financial independence means having enough savings, investments, and passive income to cover living expenses without relying on traditional employment. The FIRE movement, which stands for Financial Independence Retire Early, has attracted millions of followers worldwide.\n\nFollowers of the FIRE movement typically aim to save and invest 50 to 70 percent of their income, far more than the 10 to 15 percent recommended by conventional financial advisors. They achieve this through a combination of increasing income, reducing expenses, and investing aggressively in index funds and real estate.\n\nThe math behind FIRE is straightforward. By saving a high percentage of income and investing it wisely, a person can accumulate 25 to 30 times their annual expenses within 10 to 15 years. At that point, they can live off investment returns without needing to work.\n\nCritics of the FIRE movement point out several limitations. The strategy works best for high-income earners and may not be realistic for people with lower salaries. It also requires significant sacrifice in terms of current lifestyle, and unexpected expenses like medical emergencies can derail even the best-laid plans.\n\nRegardless of whether someone aims for early retirement, the principles behind FIRE, including living below your means, investing regularly, and being intentional about spending, can benefit anyone seeking greater financial security.",
