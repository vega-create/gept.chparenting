As society evolves, people are becoming more aware of its importance.\n\nResearch shows that education and awareness are crucial. Schools have begun adding relevant courses to help students understand these issues.\n\nCollaboration between government, organizations, and individuals is essential. Working together creates effective solutions.\n\nTechnology provides new tools for progress. Digital platforms help share information and connect people.
