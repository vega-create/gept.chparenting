    passage: "The benefits of regular exercise go far beyond physical fitness. According to recent studies, people who exercise at least 150 minutes per week have a 30% lower risk of heart disease and a 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Exercise also has significant mental health benefits. When we exercise, our bodies release endorphins, which are chemicals that naturally improve our mood and reduce stress. Many psychologists now recommend exercise as part of treatment for depression and anxiety. Additionally, regular physical activity improves sleep quality, boosts memory, and increases concentration. For students, this means better academic performance. The key is to find an activity you enjoy, whether it's swimming, cycling, dancing, or simply walking. Experts suggest starting with just 20 minutes a day and gradually increasing the duration. The most important thing is consistency — exercising regularly is more beneficial than doing intense workouts occasionally.",

      passage: "The rise of esports has challenged traditional notions of what constitutes a sport. Professional video game competitions now fill arenas with thousands of spectators and attract millions of online viewers. Top esports players earn salaries comparable to traditional athletes, with some tournaments offering prize pools exceeding 30 million dollars.\n\nProponents argue that esports requires many of the same skills as traditional sports: quick reflexes, strategic thinking, teamwork, and thousands of hours of practice. Professional gamers follow strict training regimes, often practicing for eight to twelve hours a day, and many teams employ coaches, nutritionists, and sports psychologists.\n\nCritics, however, argue that the lack of physical activity disqualifies esports from being considered a true sport. They point out that sitting for extended periods can lead to health problems such as repetitive strain injuries, poor posture, and obesity. Some traditional sports fans also feel that esports lack the physical drama and excitement of athletic competition.\n\nDespite the debate, esports continues to grow rapidly. Several countries have recognized esports as an official sport, and there is ongoing discussion about including esports in future Olympic Games. Universities around the world now offer esports scholarships, and the industry is projected to generate over 1.5 billion dollars in revenue annually.\n\nWhether or not esports is classified as a sport, its cultural and economic impact is undeniable. The gaming industry has created a new form of entertainment and competition that resonates with millions of people worldwide.",
