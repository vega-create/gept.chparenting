    passage: "The topic of 交通與運輸 has gained increasing attention in recent years. As society evolves, people are becoming more aware of its importance.\n\nResearch shows that education and awareness are crucial. Schools have begun adding relevant courses to help students understand these issues.\n\nCollaboration between government, organizations, and individuals is essential. Working together creates effective solutions.\n\nTechnology provides new tools for progress. Digital platforms help share information and connect people. However, responsible use and equal access are important.\n\nThe future depends on continued effort and innovation. While challenges remain, growing engagement gives reason for optimism.",

    passage: "Autonomous vehicles are no longer science fiction. Major companies are investing billions to develop cars that navigate without human input. Many modern vehicles already include semi-autonomous features like automatic parking and lane-keeping assistance.\n\nProponents argue self-driving cars could dramatically reduce traffic accidents caused by human error. They also benefit elderly and disabled individuals who cannot drive.\n\nCritics raise safety concerns, as accidents involving autonomous vehicles have occurred during testing. Legal questions remain about responsibility when a self-driving car causes an accident.\n\nThe ethical implications are complex. In unavoidable accident situations, how should an autonomous vehicle react? Engineers and lawmakers are still working to answer these questions.",
