    passage: "The rise of social media has fundamentally changed how businesses market their products. Traditional advertising through TV, radio, and newspapers is being replaced by digital marketing strategies that are more targeted and cost-effective. Today, even a small business can reach thousands of potential customers through platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Content marketing — creating valuable content to attract and engage customers — has become one of the most effective strategies. Successful companies tell stories, share useful information, and build communities around their brands rather than simply pushing advertisements. Influencer marketing has also exploded, with businesses paying popular social media personalities to promote their products. Search engine optimization (SEO) ensures that potential customers can find businesses online. Perhaps the biggest advantage of digital marketing is the ability to measure everything. Through analytics tools, businesses can track exactly how many people see their ads, click on them, and make purchases. This data-driven approach allows companies to optimize their marketing spending and achieve better results. However, the rapidly changing landscape of digital marketing also means businesses must constantly adapt and learn new strategies to stay competitive.",

      passage: "Social media marketing has fundamentally transformed how businesses reach and engage with customers. Unlike traditional advertising, which broadcasts messages to a mass audience, social media allows companies to target specific demographics, interact directly with consumers, and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in real time.\n\nInfluencer marketing has become one of the fastest-growing segments of social media marketing. Brands pay social media personalities with large followings to promote their products, often in a way that appears natural and authentic. The global influencer marketing industry was valued at over 16 billion dollars in 2023 and continues to grow rapidly.\n\nHowever, social media marketing comes with significant challenges. Algorithms that determine what users see are constantly changing, making it difficult for businesses to maintain consistent reach. Negative reviews or viral complaints can damage a brand's reputation within hours. There is also growing consumer skepticism about paid influencer content.\n\nDespite these challenges, businesses that use social media effectively can build strong brand communities, generate customer loyalty, and achieve significant growth with relatively small budgets. The key is to create authentic, valuable content that genuinely helps or entertains the audience rather than simply pushing sales messages.\n\nAs social media platforms continue to evolve with features like live shopping, augmented reality try-ons, and AI-powered personalization, the line between social media and e-commerce is becoming increasingly blurred.",
