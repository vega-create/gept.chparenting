    passage: "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution, and scientists warn that we are running out of time to prevent catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe main cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These activities release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the planet to warm.\n\nThe effects of climate change are already visible around the world. Glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods are becoming more frequent and severe. These changes threaten food security, water supplies, and the survival of countless species.\n\nTo address this crisis, countries around the world have signed agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many nations are investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, and individuals are being encouraged to reduce their carbon footprint by using public transportation, eating less meat, and consuming less energy.\n\nWhile the challenge is enormous, there is still hope. If we act quickly and decisively, we can limit global warming and create a more sustainable future for generations to come. The question is: will we act in time?",

      passage: "Urban farming has become a growing trend in cities around the world. As urban populations continue to increase, the demand for locally grown food has never been higher. Rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and community plots are transforming unused city spaces into productive agricultural areas.\n\nOne of the main advantages of urban farming is that it reduces the distance food needs to travel from farm to table. Traditional agriculture often requires transporting produce hundreds or thousands of kilometers, which generates significant carbon emissions. By growing food locally, cities can reduce their carbon footprint while providing fresher produce to residents.\n\nVertical farming, in particular, has attracted significant investment. These indoor farms use LED lights and hydroponic systems to grow crops in stacked layers, using up to 95 percent less water than traditional farming. A single vertical farm building can produce the same amount of food as several hectares of conventional farmland.\n\nHowever, critics point out that urban farming has limitations. The startup costs for vertical farms are extremely high, and the energy required to power the LED lights can be substantial. Additionally, urban farms tend to focus on leafy greens and herbs rather than staple crops like wheat or rice.\n\nDespite these challenges, urban farming represents an important step toward building more sustainable and resilient food systems in our increasingly urbanized world.",
