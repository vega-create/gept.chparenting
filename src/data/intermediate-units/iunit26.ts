    passage: "Street performance, or busking, has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations. Today, buskers entertain passersby with music, magic, and acrobatics worldwide.\n\nIn many cities, performers must audition for permits. In London's Covent Garden, only about 100 performers hold coveted permits selected from thousands of applicants.\n\nTop performers in tourist areas can earn several hundred dollars in a single day. Ed Sheeran and Tracy Chapman started as street performers.\n\nHowever, some cities have tightened regulations due to noise complaints. The rise of cashless payment has also affected buskers, though many now accept digital payments.",
