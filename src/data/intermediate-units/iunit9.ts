      passage: "The relationship between art and society has always been deeply intertwined. Throughout history, art has served as a mirror reflecting the values, struggles, and aspirations of the time. From the cave paintings of our ancient ancestors to the digital art of today, creative expression has been a fundamental part of the human experience.\n\nIn the modern era, technology has dramatically transformed how art is created, distributed, and consumed. Digital tools have made it possible for anyone with a computer or smartphone to create music, videos, and visual art. Streaming platforms have given independent artists access to global audiences, breaking down the barriers that once limited who could succeed in the entertainment industry.\n\nHowever, this democratization of art has also raised new challenges. With so much content being produced, it can be difficult for individual artists to stand out. The economic model of streaming pays artists significantly less per play or view compared to traditional sales, making it harder for many to earn a living from their art.\n\nDespite these challenges, art continues to play a vital role in society. It brings people together, challenges our thinking, and provides comfort during difficult times. During the pandemic, people turned to art — watching movies, reading books, listening to music, and creating their own works — as a way to cope with isolation and uncertainty.\n\nThe future of art is likely to be shaped by emerging technologies such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. AI can now create paintings, compose music, and write stories, raising fascinating questions about creativity, authorship, and what it means to be human.\n\nAs we navigate this new landscape, one thing remains clear: the human desire to create and appreciate beauty is timeless.",

      passage: "Street art has evolved from an act of vandalism into a respected form of artistic expression that transforms urban landscapes around the world. What was once considered illegal graffiti is now celebrated in galleries, museums, and public spaces, with some street artists achieving international fame and commanding high prices for their work.\n\nThe most famous street artist is arguably Banksy, whose provocative and politically charged works have appeared on walls in cities from London to New York. Despite remaining anonymous, Banksy's art has sold for millions of dollars at auction, challenging traditional notions of what constitutes fine art.\n\nCities have increasingly embraced street art as a tool for urban renewal. Neglected neighborhoods have been revitalized through mural projects that attract tourists and instill pride in local residents. In cities like Melbourne, Berlin, and Taipei, guided street art tours have become popular tourist activities.\n\nHowever, the commercialization of street art raises important questions. Some argue that when street art moves from the streets to galleries and corporate advertisements, it loses its rebellious spirit and authentic connection to the community. Others believe that commercial success allows artists to reach wider audiences and create more ambitious projects.\n\nRegardless of these debates, street art continues to challenge boundaries between high art and popular culture, public space and private property, vandalism and beauty. It remains one of the most dynamic and accessible forms of artistic expression in the modern world.",
