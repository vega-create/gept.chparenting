    passage: "In today's digital age, the way people consume news has changed dramatically. Traditional media, such as newspapers and television, are no longer the primary sources of information for many people. Instead, social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok have become the go-to places for news.\n\nThis shift has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, news spreads faster than ever before, and people have access to a wider variety of perspectives. Anyone can share information, which makes news more democratic.\n\nHowever, there are serious concerns about the quality of information online. Fake news and misinformation spread just as quickly as real news, and it can be difficult for people to tell the difference. Studies show that false stories are 70% more likely to be shared on social media than true stories.\n\nMedia literacy has become an essential skill in the 21st century. Experts recommend that people should always check multiple sources before believing a story, look for evidence and data to support claims, and be aware of their own biases. Schools are beginning to include media literacy in their curriculum to help young people become more critical consumers of information.\n\nThe future of news is uncertain, but one thing is clear: in an age of information overload, the ability to think critically about what we read and share has never been more important.",

      passage: "Podcasts have emerged as one of the fastest-growing forms of media in recent years. Unlike traditional radio, podcasts allow listeners to choose what they want to hear and when they want to hear it. This on-demand nature has made podcasts incredibly popular, especially among younger audiences.\n\nThe podcast industry has grown from a niche hobby into a multi-billion-dollar business. Major companies like Spotify and Apple have invested heavily in exclusive podcast content, while independent creators have found success through platforms that allow direct listener support.\n\nOne of the most significant impacts of podcasts has been on journalism. Investigative podcast series have uncovered wrongful convictions, exposed corporate fraud, and brought attention to stories that mainstream media overlooked. Some podcast investigations have even led to real legal changes.\n\nHowever, the rapid growth of podcasts has also raised concerns. Unlike traditional media outlets, most podcasts are not subject to the same editorial standards and fact-checking processes. This means that misinformation can spread through podcasts just as easily as through social media.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of podcasting looks bright. Industry analysts predict that the global podcast audience will exceed one billion listeners by 2030, making it one of the most influential media formats of the 21st century.",
