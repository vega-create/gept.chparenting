    passage: "Artificial intelligence is transforming nearly every field of science. In medicine, AI algorithms can analyze medical images and detect diseases such as cancer with accuracy that sometimes surpasses human doctors. In drug discovery, AI can screen millions of potential compounds in days, a process that previously took years. Climate scientists use AI models to predict weather patterns and understand the complex dynamics of climate change. In astronomy, AI helps analyze data from telescopes to discover new planets and galaxies. Perhaps most excitingly, AI is being used to accelerate scientific research itself. Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns in vast datasets that humans might miss, leading to new hypotheses and discoveries. However, the use of AI in science also raises important questions. Can we trust AI-generated results? How do we ensure that AI models are not biased? Who is responsible when AI makes an error? As AI becomes more integrated into scientific research, these questions will become increasingly important. Most scientists agree that AI is a powerful tool, but it should complement human judgment, not replace it.",

      passage: "CRISPR gene editing technology has been called the most significant scientific breakthrough of the 21st century. CRISPR allows scientists to precisely edit DNA, the genetic code that determines the characteristics of all living organisms. The technology works like molecular scissors, cutting DNA at specific locations and allowing scientists to remove, replace, or insert genetic material.\n\nThe potential applications of CRISPR are enormous. In medicine, it could be used to cure genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and certain types of cancer. Clinical trials are already underway, and early results have been promising. In agriculture, CRISPR could create crops that are more resistant to drought, disease, and pests, helping to address global food security.\n\nHowever, CRISPR also raises profound ethical questions. In 2018, a Chinese scientist shocked the world by announcing that he had edited the genes of twin baby girls to make them resistant to HIV. The scientific community condemned the experiment as irresponsible and dangerous, as the long-term effects of gene editing on humans are unknown.\n\nThe debate over gene editing centers on the distinction between somatic editing, which affects only the individual patient, and germline editing, which changes genes that can be passed to future generations. Most scientists support somatic editing for treating diseases but oppose germline editing until it is better understood.\n\nAs CRISPR technology continues to advance, the challenge for society is to harness its benefits while establishing clear ethical guidelines to prevent misuse. The decisions we make today about gene editing will shape the future of human biology for generations to come.",
