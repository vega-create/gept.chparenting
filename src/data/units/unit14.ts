We walked around and looked at all the lanterns. My little sister loved the rabbit lantern the most. We also ate tangyuan, which are sweet rice balls in hot soup. They tasted delicious! At eight o'clock, there was a special show. They released sky lanterns into the air. Each lantern had people's wishes written on it. I wrote 'I hope to do well on my exams' on mine. It was a magical night. I hope to go again next year!",
