    passage: "Smartphones have changed our lives in many ways. Today, most people use smartphones every day. We use them to make calls, send messages, take photos, watch videos, and surf the internet.\n\nSmartphones are very convenient. We can find information quickly by searching online. We can use maps to find our way when we are lost. We can also shop online, order food, and pay bills with our phones. Some students even use their phones to study English.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with using smartphones too much. Some people become addicted to their phones. They spend too much time on social media or playing games. This can be bad for their eyes and their sleep. Also, spending too much time on the phone means less time for face-to-face communication with family and friends.\n\nExperts say that we should use our smartphones wisely. We should limit our screen time and take breaks. We should also be careful about online safety and not share personal information with strangers. Smartphones are great tools, but we should use them properly.",

We can send messages, make video calls, and share photos instantly. We can also use apps to learn new things, play games, or listen to music. However, there are some problems with using phones too much. Many students spend too many hours on their phones and don't get enough sleep. Some people look at their phones during meals instead of talking to their families. Experts say that too much screen time can hurt our eyes and affect our concentration. Here are some tips for healthy phone use: First, don't use your phone one hour before bed. Second, take a break from your phone every thirty minutes.
