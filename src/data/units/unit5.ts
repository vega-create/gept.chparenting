    passage: "My name is Leo. I am a seventh grader. Let me tell you about my daily routine. On weekdays, my alarm goes off at 6:00 AM. I usually get up at 6:10. First, I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then I get dressed and eat breakfast. I usually have toast, an egg, and a glass of milk for breakfast. I leave home at 7:00 and walk to school with my neighbor, Jason. It takes about fifteen minutes. School starts at 7:30 and ends at 4:00 PM. We have seven classes every day with a lunch break at noon.

I take a shower at 9:30 and then read a book in bed. I usually fall asleep before 10:30. On weekends, my routine is very different. I sleep in until 9:00. I spend the morning doing chores like cleaning my room. In the afternoon, I often play basketball with my friends or go to the library. I love weekends because I have more free time!",
