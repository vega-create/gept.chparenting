    passage: "Everyone has different emotions. Sometimes we feel happy, and sometimes we feel sad. It is normal to have many kinds of feelings. The important thing is to know how to deal with them.\n\nWhen you feel angry, try to take a deep breath and count to ten. This can help you calm down. Talking to someone you trust, like a parent or a friend, is also helpful. Don't keep your feelings inside. It's OK to express how you feel.\n\nWhen you feel sad or lonely, remember that it won't last forever. Try to do something you enjoy, like listening to music or taking a walk. Spending time with friends and family can also make you feel better.\n\nWhen you feel stressed about schoolwork, try to make a plan. Break big tasks into smaller ones. Don't forget to take breaks and get enough sleep. Exercise is also a great way to reduce stress.\n\nRemember, it's OK to ask for help when you need it. Everyone needs support sometimes.
