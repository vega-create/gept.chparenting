    passage: "Taiwan has a tropical and subtropical climate. It is warm most of the year. In summer, the temperature often goes above 35 degrees Celsius. It is very hot and humid. Many people go to the beach or the mountains to cool off. Typhoons sometimes hit Taiwan between July and September. They bring heavy rain and strong winds. In autumn, the weather becomes cooler and more comfortable. Many people enjoy hiking and having picnics in the parks. The leaves on some mountains turn yellow and red, creating beautiful scenery. Winter in Taiwan is mild compared to other countries. The temperature usually stays between 10 and 20 degrees in the north. However, it can be very cold and windy on some days. In the south, winter is warmer and drier. Spring is short but pleasant. Cherry blossoms bloom in the mountains, and many tourists visit Yangmingshan National Park to see the flowers. Taiwan's climate is changing because of global warming. We should all try to protect the environment by saving energy, recycling, and planting more trees.",
