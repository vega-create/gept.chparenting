    passage: "Greenville is a small town with about 20,000 people. It used to be very quiet and boring. But in the last few years, the town has changed a lot.\n\nFirst, the government built a new library and a community center. The library has thousands of books, free Wi-Fi, and a reading room for children. The community center has a gym, a swimming pool, and rooms for classes and events.\n\nSecond, they improved public transportation. New bus routes were added, and bus stops were built every two blocks. Now it is easy to get around town without a car.\n\nThird, the town started a 'Green Greenville' project. Residents planted trees along the streets and created community gardens. They also set up recycling stations in every neighborhood. As a result, the town is now much cleaner and greener.\n\nMany people have moved to Greenville because it is safe, clean, and convenient. The residents are friendly and often participate in community events. Greenville shows that a small town can become a great place to live when everyone works together.",

      passage: "Our neighborhood held a community cleanup day last Sunday. About fifty people joined the event, including students, parents, and elderly people. We were divided into five groups. Each group was responsible for cleaning a different area. My group cleaned the park near the school. We picked up trash, pulled out weeds, and swept the paths. We filled ten big bags of trash! Some people found plastic bottles, food wrappers, and even old shoes. Another group cleaned the streets and sidewalks. They also painted the old benches in the park. After three hours of hard work, our neighborhood looked much cleaner and nicer. The community leader thanked everyone and said, 'A clean environment makes everyone happier.' We also planted five new trees in the park. I felt proud to help make our community a better place. I hope more people will join us next time!",
