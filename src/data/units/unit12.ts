    passage: "Taiwan is a beautiful island with many kinds of animals and plants. The mountains are covered with forests. In these forests, you can find many special animals, such as the Formosan black bear, the Formosan rock monkey, and many kinds of birds.\n\nThe Formosan black bear is the largest wild animal in Taiwan. It lives in the mountains and eats fruit, insects, and honey. Sadly, there are only about 200 to 600 Formosan black bears left in the wild. They are an endangered species.\n\nTo protect these animals, the government has created national parks and nature reserves. Yushan National Park and Taroko National Park are two famous examples. In these parks, people cannot hunt animals or cut down trees.\n\nWe can also help protect nature in our daily life. We should recycle, save energy, and not waste water.
