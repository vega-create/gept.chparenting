    passage: "Every school in Taiwan has its own uniform. Students wear uniforms from Monday to Friday. Most school uniforms include a white shirt and dark pants or a skirt. In summer, students can wear short-sleeved shirts and shorts.\n\nSome students like wearing uniforms because they don't need to think about what to wear every day. It also means that all students look the same, so no one feels bad about their clothes. However, other students think uniforms are boring and uncomfortable. They want to express their own style.\n\nOn special days like school trips or Sports Day, students can usually wear casual clothes. Many students enjoy these days because they can finally show their personal style. Some students dress up in fashionable outfits, while others just wear comfortable jeans and T-shirts.\n\nWhatever students wear, the most important thing is to be clean and neat.

I need a black robe, round glasses, and a magic wand. My mother helped me make the robe from an old black curtain. I borrowed round glasses from my friend, and I made a wand from a wooden stick. My best friend, Kevin, is going as Spider-Man. He bought a red and blue Spider-Man suit online. It cost him six hundred dollars. Another friend, Cindy, is going as Elsa from Frozen.
