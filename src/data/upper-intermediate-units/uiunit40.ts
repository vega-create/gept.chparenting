    passage: "The application of lidar technology to archaeology has produced some of the most dramatic discoveries of recent decades. Lidar, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, works by firing rapid pulses of laser light from aircraft and measuring how long they take to bounce back from the ground. By processing millions of these measurements, scientists can create detailed three-dimensional maps of terrain, even when it is covered by dense vegetation.\n\nIn 2018, researchers used lidar to reveal a vast network of ancient Maya cities beneath the jungle canopy of Guatemala. The survey covered more than 2,000 square kilometers and identified over 60,000 previously unknown structures, including pyramids, palaces, causeways, and agricultural terraces. The findings suggested that the Maya civilization was far larger and more interconnected than scholars had previously believed, with a population that may have reached 10 to 15 million at its peak.\n\nLidar has since been applied to archaeological sites around the world, from the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia to medieval landscapes in Europe. While the technology cannot replace traditional excavation, it dramatically accelerates the process of discovery and allows archaeologists to identify promising sites for further investigation. As lidar technology becomes more affordable and accessible, it promises to reshape our understanding of the ancient world.",

    passage: "The discovery of Gobekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey has fundamentally challenged the conventional narrative of human civilization. Dating to approximately 9600 BCE, this site contains massive stone pillars carved with intricate animal reliefs, making it the oldest known monumental architecture in the world.\n\nWhat makes Gobekli Tepe revolutionary is that it was built by hunter-gatherers before the development of agriculture or permanent settlements. Previously, archaeologists believed that complex architecture required settled agricultural communities with surplus food to support specialized laborers.\n\nThe site suggests that the desire to build monuments and gather for ritual purposes may have actually driven the development of agriculture, rather than the other way around. People may have started farming specifically to support the labor force needed to construct and maintain such sites.\n\nGobekli Tepe was deliberately buried around 8000 BCE for unknown reasons, which ironically helped preserve it. Ongoing excavations continue to reveal new structures, and archaeologists estimate that only about 5 percent of the site has been uncovered so far.",
