    passage: "Disaster preparedness is a critical component of public safety that involves planning, training, and resource allocation before a catastrophe occurs. Governments around the world invest in early warning systems, emergency shelters, and communication networks to minimize casualties. Communities that conduct regular drills and maintain emergency supply kits tend to recover more quickly from natural disasters. However, developing nations often lack the infrastructure and funding needed for comprehensive preparedness programs, making them disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of earthquakes, floods, and storms.",

    passage: "The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, adopted by United Nations member states in 2015, represents a fundamental shift in how the international community approaches disasters. Rather than focusing primarily on emergency response, the framework emphasizes prevention, preparedness, and building resilience before disasters strike.\n\nThe framework establishes four priority areas: understanding disaster risk through improved data collection and analysis; strengthening disaster risk governance at all levels; investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and recovery.\n\nOne of the framework's most significant contributions is its emphasis on understanding the systemic nature of risk. Disasters rarely have single causes; they result from complex interactions between natural hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and capacity. A flood becomes a disaster not because of rainfall alone, but because of factors such as deforestation, inadequate drainage, poverty, and poor urban planning.\n\nImplementation has been uneven across countries. Wealthier nations have made significant progress in early warning systems and building codes, while developing countries often lack the resources and institutional capacity to implement comprehensive risk reduction strategies.",
