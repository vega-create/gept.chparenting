    passage: "The rise of decentralized finance, commonly known as DeFi, represents a fundamental shift in how financial services are delivered. Unlike traditional banking, which relies on centralized institutions to facilitate transactions, DeFi uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to create open, permissionless financial systems. Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest without intermediaries. While DeFi offers greater accessibility and transparency, it also presents significant risks including smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory uncertainty, and extreme market volatility. As the sector matures, finding the balance between innovation and consumer protection will be a defining challenge for policymakers worldwide.",

    passage: "The rise of cryptocurrency has forced a fundamental reconsideration of what money is and how it functions in society. Traditional money derives its value from government backing and institutional trust. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, by contrast, derive their value from mathematical scarcity and distributed consensus mechanisms.\n\nBitcoin's blockchain technology ensures that transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger that cannot be altered by any single entity. This transparency and immutability have attracted both enthusiasts who see it as a tool for financial freedom and critics who worry about its use in illegal activities.\n\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining has become a major concern. Bitcoin mining alone consumes more electricity than some countries, raising questions about sustainability. Some newer cryptocurrencies have adopted proof-of-stake mechanisms that require far less energy.\n\nDespite volatility and regulatory uncertainty, institutional adoption of cryptocurrency continues to accelerate. Major corporations now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and traditional banks are offering cryptocurrency custody services to clients.",
