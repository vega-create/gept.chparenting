    passage: "The global energy transition presents one of the greatest challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind have seen dramatic cost reductions and rapid deployment, they face the fundamental challenge of intermittency. Nuclear energy, which provides reliable baseload power with minimal carbon emissions, has reemerged as a topic of serious discussion. Proponents argue that advanced reactor designs are significantly safer than previous generations and that nuclear is essential for achieving net-zero targets. Opponents counter that the risks of radioactive waste, high construction costs, and the potential for catastrophic accidents make nuclear an unacceptable option. The debate highlights the complex trade-offs inherent in building a sustainable energy future.",

    passage: "The concept of a just transition has become central to energy policy discussions worldwide. As countries shift away from fossil fuels, millions of workers in coal, oil, and gas industries face job losses. A just transition aims to ensure these workers are not left behind.\n\nGermany's experience provides valuable lessons. The country's decision to phase out coal by 2038 included a 40-billion-euro package to support affected regions, including retraining programs, infrastructure investments, and early retirement options for older workers.\n\nHowever, critics argue that transition programs often fall short. Retraining a coal miner to install solar panels sounds straightforward, but the reality is more complex. New jobs may pay less, require relocation, or demand skills that take years to develop.\n\nDeveloping countries face even greater challenges. For nations where fossil fuel exports constitute a significant portion of GDP, the energy transition threatens economic stability. International financial support and technology transfer will be essential to ensure the transition is equitable globally.",
