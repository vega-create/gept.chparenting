    passage: "The Innocence Project, founded in 1992 by lawyers Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, has become one of the most influential organizations in criminal justice reform. Its primary mission is to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals through the use of DNA testing and to reform the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.\n\nSince its founding, the Innocence Project has helped free over 375 people who were wrongfully convicted, including 21 who spent time on death row. The average exoneree served 14 years in prison before being cleared. These cases have revealed systemic problems, including eyewitness misidentification, false confessions, unreliable forensic science, and prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nEyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions, contributing to approximately 69% of the cases overturned by DNA evidence. Research has shown that human memory is far less reliable than commonly believed, and factors such as stress, cross-racial identification, and suggestive police procedures can significantly distort eyewitness accounts.\n\nThe organization has also advocated for policy reforms, including the recording of interrogations, improved eyewitness identification procedures, and the preservation of biological evidence. Many states have adopted these reforms, though implementation remains inconsistent across the country.\n\nThe work of the Innocence Project raises fundamental questions about the balance between public safety and individual rights, and challenges the assumption that the criminal justice system always delivers accurate results.",

    passage: "The concept of predictive policing uses algorithms to forecast where crimes are likely to occur, allowing law enforcement to allocate resources preemptively. Proponents argue it makes policing more efficient and can reduce crime rates in targeted areas.\n\nHowever, predictive policing has faced intense criticism. The algorithms are trained on historical crime data, which reflects decades of biased policing practices. Communities that were over-policed in the past are flagged as high-risk, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of surveillance and arrests.\n\nStudies have shown that predictive policing disproportionately targets low-income and minority neighborhoods. When more officers are deployed to these areas, they naturally discover more crime, which feeds back into the algorithm as confirmation of its predictions.\n\nSeveral cities have abandoned predictive policing programs after community opposition. Others are developing more transparent algorithms that incorporate input from affected communities and include safeguards against racial and socioeconomic bias.",
